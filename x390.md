### Keyboard Info

* Part number: 01YP160
* Compatible with X390, X395, X280 (unconfirmed)
* Components: 6-row keyboard, trackpoint, 3 buttons.
* Interface: 1-mm pitch 12-pin FPC for the trackpoint; 0.5-mm pitch 36-pin FPC for the keys and buttons.

#### Trackpoint

This trackpoint doesn't use a TPM745 chip. So the prior knowledge doesn't apply here. We need to start from scatch. Again, ground is usually the easiest to find out. So here we go. A quick continuity test revealted that pin 7 is connected to the chasis and thus must be ground. Then I looked at the traces. Pin 1 has the thickest trace other than ground. So it's a good candidate for Vcc. From there, I turned into the big capacitors. A couple of them are connnected to ground on one end. And the other end of one is connected to pin 1. And pin 1 is also connected to a resistor (blocked by the golden FPC in the picture). So I'm pretty confident pin 1 is Vcc.

With Vcc and ground correctly determined, there's little chance you'd fry the controller. So I hooked it up to an Arduino Uno using a FPC connector breakout board. A few trial and errors later, the data and clock pins were identified. Then I shorted the rest pins to ground one by one and observe the output to determine which pins are for the 3 buttons. After that, the remaining single pin must be reset.

#### Keyboard Matrix

Determining the keyboard matrix is done the same way as the [other keyboard](README.md).

Interestingly, this matrix is very similar to the other one, including the wire order, but with a couple of minor differences, namely, `Home`, `Ins`, `Ins`, `PrtSc`, `PgUp` and `PgDn`.

#### LED indicators

This keyboard has 4 LED indicators. After determining the keyboard matrix, it's just a matter of trial and error to figure out the pinout for the indicators. I just hooked up a 3.3 V power supply with a 100 Ohm resistor and tried all the combinations. Unlike the backlight, these LEDs require very little current and are not controlled by a MOSFET.

```
W12: Common anode
W06: caps lock
W09: mic mute
W10: speaker mute
W11: Fn lock
```

Caps lock indicator is a standard HID keyboard indicator, and it is supported by QMK. We can turn on Fn LED when the Fn layer is active. This can be easily done in QMK. I don't know what to do with the mic and speaker mute LEDs yet. They are not part of HID keyboard spec. Maybe I can use them as layer indicators.

The total pin count is 32 for this keyboard.
